This is a fork of the standard chucknorris plugin to allow users to
opt-in/opt-out from seeing Chuck, depending on whether the global
default is set to show Chuck without opt-out, or to not show Chuck
without opt-in.

I'll probably fold this into the actual plugin, but didn't want to
step on toes yet.
